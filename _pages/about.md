I am an Assistant Professor in the College of Mathematics and Computer Science at Fuzhou University. I obtained my Ph.D. from Yuan Ze University in 2020, working with [Dr. Bo-Hao Chen](https://bigmms.github.io/). I study computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning with the goal of applying academic competence and programming skills to devise a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks. I have closely collarborated with [Dr. Yan-Tsung Peng](https://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/~ytpeng/) in National Chengchi University, Taiwan, and [Dr. Chung-Chi Tsai](https://github.com/chungchi) in  Qualcomm Technologies Inc., USA, from 2019.
